# Productivity App

This website was created for my 4th Portfolio Project with Code Institute. Productivity App is multifacited app with mutliple features including a chat app and a task management system for both site users and site admins (called external users). The purpose behind this app is to provide users in companies or even education centers a platform to manage daily tasks and effectively communicate with each other seemlessly.

## User Experience Design

## Strategy

### __Typical Users__
  
  - A typical Site User would be an employee in a companee or student in a school who needs to have the daily tasks supervised and managed.

  - The Site Admin would be a manager in a company or a teacher in a school that supervises the tasks or regular users.


### User Stories

#### Site User

<br>

  - Account Register: I can sign up or log in to an account so that I can access all chat and task management features.

  - Edit Profile: I can edit my personal profile to have my own user image and decide what information is displayed.

  - Send Message (Public Channel): I can send a message in a public channel so that I can participate in group discussions.

  - Send Message (Private Channel): I can send a direct message to another user or a group so that I can have private conversations.

  - View Chat History: I can view past messages in a public or private channel so that I can keep track of previous conversations.

  - Edit Message: I can edit my own messages so that I can correct mistakes or update information.

  - Delete Message: I can delete my own messages so that I can remove unwanted or incorrect messages.

  - Manage Tasks: I can create, read, update, and delete my own tasks so that I can keep track of my work.

  - View Task Details: I can view the details of my tasks so that I can understand deadlines, descriptions, and progress.

  - Complete Task: I can mark a task as complete so that I can track progress and know what has been finished.

  - Filter and Sort Tasks: I can filter and sort my tasks by priority, deadline, or status so that I can focus on important tasks.

<br>

#### Superuser (Admin)

<br>

  - Manage Public Channels: I can create, edit, and delete public channels so that I can structure discussions properly.

  - Delete Message: I can delete any message in public and private chats so that I can ensure a respectful and safe environment.

  - Manage Tasks (All Users): I can create, update, and delete tasks for any user so that I can oversee task management.

  - View All Tasks: I can view all tasks assigned to users so that I can monitor work progress.

  - Manage User Accounts: I can suspend, delete, or modify user accounts so that I can maintain control over the platform.

## Scope

<br>

An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach was taken to the development of this site. The main features deemed as basic requirements for this site were:

- Account Registration
- CRUD Functionality (Both for Site User and Site Admin)
- Device Responsiveness

 For a more detailed explanation of all existing features see [Existing Features](#existing-features). [Future Features](#future-features) were still within the possible scope of this project, they were not necessary at this point in time for the site to still work.

## Structure

### Site Navigation Flowchart

  The Flow chart was made to see the structure of navigation on the page. The flowchart was created with [Lucid](https://lucid.app/documents#/dashboard).
